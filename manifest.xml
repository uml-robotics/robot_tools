  <description brief="robot_tools">

    Contains minimalistic tools each of which only does one
    thing and can be universally used by anybody.
    Tools that are short and can be contained within few
    files are welcome.

    Big complex tools do not belong here.
    Once the tool is too big, move it somewhere else.

    Tools with non-standard dependencies do not belong here.
